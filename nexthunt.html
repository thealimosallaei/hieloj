<!--h3>The Next Hunt</h3-->

<p>Greetings puzzlers!</p>

<p>Setec Astronomy is surprised and pleased to announce that the 39th
annual MIT Mystery Hunt will begin at noon on Friday, January 18,
2019. Hunt will end at 5:00 pm on Sunday or when the coin is found,
whichever is later. Wrap-up will take place at noon on Monday. We look
forward to a fun-filled weekend of puzzles!</p>

<h3>Join the Puzzle Club</h3>

<p>Current MIT Students: Join the student group for Hunt: Puzzle Club!
The group meets every month or two on campus to do Mystery Hunt-style
puzzles together and eat free food. Help get your fellow students
excited about Hunt. For occasional announcements and info, subscribe
to puzzle-club-announce
<a href="https://groups.mit.edu/webmoira/list/puzzle-club-announce" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h3>How to Play</h3>

<p>Many teams have already been formed, but it&rsquo;s not too late to
play! You can either join an existing team that is open to taking on
new members, or you can form a team of your own.</p>

<p><b><i>Join a team:</i></b> The easiest way to do this is to join
the Unattached Hunters list (see below), and we&rsquo;ll work to match
you with the right team. Another option, if you&rsquo;re an MIT
student, is to look for a team that&rsquo;s affiliated with your dorm,
FSILG, club, or department. You can ask around,
or <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> and we&rsquo;ll help put
you in touch with teams near you.</p>

<p><b><i>Form a team:</i></b> Gather your friends, come up with a
cool team name, and register as a team!  Teams can be any size, but we
recommend at least 6 people and no more than 75. It&rsquo;s too late
this year to request classroom space, but any reasonably private space
&mdash; like a department or dorm lounge &mdash; can make for a great
place to play.</p>

<h3>Team Registration</h3>

<p><b><i>Registration for the 2019 MIT Mystery Hunt:</i></b>
It&rsquo;s time to register teams! Registration is open until
Wednesday, January 16 to get the last stragglers in, but there&rsquo;s
some paperwork to do after you register, so we suggest starting the
process as soon as possible. (Note that the deadline to request
classroom space has passed and we can no longer accommodate requests
for team headquarters space.) Please register (only once per team!)
<a href="https://goo.gl/forms/4eb4Fo9V51Mtyk4L2" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>As in the past, there is no formal limit on team size, but we
recommend you keep your teams to a maximum of 75 people. The 2019 Hunt
will have mechanisms in place to ensure smaller teams are having fun
and making progress, but if your team is well over 75 strong, you
might have less fun. During the Monsters et Manus Hunt in 2017, some
competitive teams found that they gained access to a large number of
puzzles at once. That will not be the case this year; teams in
contention to finish first will likely have access to at most 12&ndash;15
puzzles at once, and experienced teams should take this into account
when deciding on team size to ensure an experience that everyone will
enjoy.</p>

<h3>Unattached Hunters</h3>

<p>If you would like to participate in Hunt but are not currently a
member of a team, we can help match you up with a team that is
welcoming unattached hunters. Please fill out
<a href="https://goo.gl/forms/qHgVipTZ32P4rSWM2" target="_blank">this
form</a>.</p>

<h3>Accommodations</h3>

<p>As always, Hunt is an MIT event and is best experienced in person
at the Institute. For those who are coming from out of town, we have
arranged discounted room blocks at several local hotels&mdash;the
Marriott Kendall Square, the Hyatt Regency, Le M&eacute;ridien, the
Royal Sonesta, and the Kendall Hotel. Details are
available <a href="lodging.html">here</a>. When planning your
accommodations, please keep in mind that headquarters will be open
until 5:00 pm on Sunday, January 20.</p>

<h3>Join the Mailing List</h3>

<p>If you would like to receive email updates about Hunt,
join the puzzle-hunters mailing list
<a href="http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/puzzle-hunters" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<!--<h3>Kickoff</h3>
<p>Teams and team members participating remotely can watch the Kickoff
live-streamed
at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRvQTy393wY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRvQTy393wY</a>.</p>
-->

<h3>Sponsorship &amp; Donations</h3>

<p>Amazingly, participating in the MIT Mystery Hunt is (and has always
been) free! Creating the event is an all-volunteer effort, and it is
made possible by generous in-kind support from MIT. The remaining
costs&mdash;like props, costumes, technology, and coins&mdash;add up
to about $10-15 per participant, which comes from sponsors
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and solvers like you! We would love to take your
tax-deductible donations as part of your earmarked gift to the
Institute! Head over to the MIT donations page
<a href="https://giving.mit.edu/givenow/start.dyn?designationId=2720842">here</a>
to help support the Hunt.</p>

<p>Hunt is also supported by generous corporate sponsors and
donors. If you are interested in becoming a sponsor, please
contact <a href="mailto:puzzle@mit.edu">our sponsorship team</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks, and we look forward to seeing you at kickoff!</p>
