    <p>The goal of each Mystery Hunt is to locate an object hidden
somewhere on MIT campus. The first few hunts used an
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_head_cent"
target="_blank">Indian Head Penny</a>, and thus this object has become
known as a &ldquo;coin,&rdquo; even though not all of them have been
actual coins. This gallery contains all the coins from the past hunts
that we've been able to track down; if you know of the coins we have
marked as &ldquo;unknown,&rdquo; or have pictures of coins for which
we only have sketches, please <a href="contact.html">contact us</a>.

    <!--p>The MIT Alumni Association also maintains <a
        href="https://alum.mit.edu/news-views/alumni-news-features/alumni-news-archive/mystery-hunt?destination=node/18238">a
        map</a> of where the coin has been hidden each year, along with
    interesting anecdotes about various Hunts.</p-->

    <h3>2014</h3>
    <a href="images/coins/2014.jpg" target="_blank" style="border:none;"><img src="images/coins/2014.jpg" class="photoframe" style="width:635px; height:auto;"></a>
    <p><em>Clock: premade object, coin material: pewter, coin technique: die stamping.</em></p>
    <p>The 2014 hunt asked solvers to hunt down a fearsome beast that
    escaped from Wonderland to the MIT campus along with a cast of
    other Wonderland characters. At the end of their quest, the
    solvers had to close a hole between the two worlds, with the White
    Rabbit's pocket watch serving as the key. The giant pocket watch
    depicted above thus served as the coin for this hunt. As a reward
    for their efforts, the members of the winning team also received
    souvenir watch-like coins (depicted below the pocketwatch) with
    pictures of Alice and other Wonderland-related characters and
    artifacts on one side and a clock with the time set to "20:14" on
    the other side.</p>

    <h3>2013</h3>
    <img src="images/coins/2013.jpg" class="photoframe">
    <p><em>Material: brass; technique: die stamping.</em></p>
    <p>The 2013 hunt involved teams pulling a heist to steal the coin from
    Enigma Valley Investment & Loan, to whom it had been mortgaged. Teams
    recruited the six experts who designed the bank's security systems and then
    had to physically circumvent these systems during the runaround. The coin
    was a one trillion dollar piece of currency.
    </p>

    <h3>2012</h3>
    <img src="images/coins/2012.jpg" class="photoframe">
    <p><em>Material: nickel-plated brass; technique: die stamping.</em></p>
    <p>The 2012 hunt was based on the film The Producers, with references to
       other Broadway shows, including Phantom of the Opera, Oklahoma, My Fair
       Lady, A Chorus Line, Man of La Mancha, Into the Woods, and Jesus Christ
       Super Star. The coin was a Tony Award, with an image of the Producers on
       one side.
    </p>

    <h3>2011</h3>
    <img src="images/coins/2011.jpg" class="photoframe">
    <p><em>Material: Baltic birch wood; technique: laser engraving.</em></p>
    <p>The 2011 hunt was based on video games, and included references to Mario, Zelda, Civilization, Mega-Man, Katamari Damacy,
       and Portal (from which the ultimate villain in the hunt was borrowed). The characters from the first five games appear on the coin, 
       while the coin itself is represented in the form of the Companion Cube, an object (or, as some may argue, a person) prominent in Portal.
    </p>

    <h3>2010</h3>
    <img src="images/coins/2010.jpg" class="photoframe">
    <p><em>Material: bronze; technique: casting.<br>
           Designed by Mark Halpin</em></p>
    <p>The 2010 hunt was based on the history of the hunt itself, and a sequence of events that transpired when the coin was hit by Professor
       Emit's Time Ray and began bouncing back in time, creating new rounds of puzzles and changing history. The two sides of the coin reflect
       the two parallel Hunt universes: the actual one where Hunt is 30 years old, and the alternate one, where Hunt is 300 years old. The years
       listed on the alternate universe side refer to the past "hunts" visited during that hunt.
    </p>

    <h3>2009</h3>
    <img src="images/coins/2009.jpg" class="photoframe">
    <p><em>Material: miscellaneous hardware, wooden plaque; technique: construction, laser engraving.</em></p>
    <p>The 2009 hunt was set in the future, where participants in a gaming convention based on the game "Escape from Zyzzlvaria" got sucked into
       the real Zyzzlvaria. In order to, well, escape from Zyzzlvaria, the participants needed to activate the Covertly Operational Inversion Node,
       or the COIN, depicted above.</p>

    <h3>2008</h3>
    <img src="images/coins/2008.jpg" class="photoframe">
    <p><em>Material: metal; technique: casting.<br>
           Designed by Mark Halpin</em></p>

    <p>The 2008 hunt was a whodunnit concerning the murder of Dr. Awkward. The coin design illustrates the concept of a classic murder mystery with 
       a human silhouette and a fingerprint. The fingerprint served as evidence that was needed to convict the murderer.</p>

    <h3>2007</h3>
    <img src="images/coins/2007.jpg" class="photoframe">
    <p><em>Material: copper; technique: lathe engraving.</em></p>
    <p>The 2007 hunt involved a descent into Hell to regain the solvers' lost souls. The souls were regained in the form of the coin, pictured above.

    <h3>2006</h3>
    <img src="images/coins/2006.jpg" class="photoframe" width="635">
    <p><em>Material: metal, glass, plastic; technique: premade object with silk-screened lettering.</em></p>
    <p>The 2006 hunt involved a mysterious intelligence agency known as S.P.I.E.S., which was trying to stop the evil Professor Moriarty from
       using the MIT Weather Machine to cover the world in eternal winter, save for one tropical island which he had purchased in advance. The
       snow globe was a key component of the MIT Weather Machine, which teams got to keep as a souvenir.
    </p>

    <h3>2005</h3>
    <img src="images/coins/2005.jpg" class="photoframe">
    <p><em>Material: mostly iron; technique: atmospheric friction</em></p>
    <p>The 2005 hunt was themed around the town of Normalville, where a number of superpower-inducing meteorites made a landing. Progressing through the
    hunt involved collecting these superpowers, and the coin was an actual piece of a meteorite. Its current whereabouts are unknown.

    <h3>2004</h3>
    <img src="images/coins/2004coin.jpg" style="width:635px; height:auto;" class="photoframe">
    <p><em>Country of origin: USA; denomination: <a href="http://en.numista.com/catalogue/pieces2356.html" target="_blank">1 cent</a>; year: 188?</em></p>
    <p>The 2004 hunt was based on the film <em>Time Bandits</em>, which features a lump of coal that is actually a piece of "concentrated evil". Naturally,
    the coin this year was found inside a lump of coal; the coin itself was an Indian Head Penny, just like in the first Mystery Hunt.</p>

    <h3>2003</h3>
    <img src="images/coins/2003.jpg" class="photoframe">
    <p><em>Material: premade CD, acrylic; technique: laser engraving, color printing</em></p>
    <p>The 2003 hunt was a corporate murder mystery that turned out to be taking place inside the Matrix. So, naturally, the coin was a compact disc,
    with an appropriate green symbol rain design and the content of the entire hunt on it.
    </p>

    <h3>2002</h3>
     <img src="images/coins/2002.jpg" class="photoframe">
    <p>The 2002 hunt was based on the <em>Monopoly</em> board game and featured a design with familiar characters. If you have an image of the actual
       coin, please contact us.
    </p>

    <h3>2001</h3>
    <img src="images/coins/2001coin.jpg" style="width:635px; height:auto;" class="photoframe">
      <p><em>Material: bloodstone, technique: natural polished stone</em></p>
    <p>The 2001 hunt, also known as the "hunt of horror", required the
       solvers to defeat Agatha Winchester, a powerful witch who was
       capable of cursing MIT with unspeakable evil. In order to beat
       her, the teams needed to recover
       her <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliotrope_(mineral)"
       target="_blank">bloodstone</a>, which acted as that year's
       coin.
    </p>

     <h3>2000</h3>
    <img src="images/coins/nophoto.jpg" class="photoframe">
    <p>The coin from 2000 was a ruby slippers plaque (a red rectangular piece of plastic with a picture of ruby slippers on it.) If you have a photo of it, please <a href="mailto:puzzle@mit.edu">let us know</a>.</p>

    <h3>1999</h3>
    <img src="images/coins/1999coin.jpg" style="width:635px; height:auto;" class="photoframe">
    <p><em>Material: brass, technique: engraving</em></p>
    <p>The 1999 hunt was based on the popular game series that featured Carmen Sandiego, and its coin was a brass puck with the words "MIT IAP Mystery Hunt" on one side, and "Carmen was here" on the other.</p>

    <h3>1998</h3>
    <img src="images/coins/1998coin.jpg" style="width:635px; height:auto;" class="photoframe">
    <p><em>Material: paper, technique: printing, forgery</em></p>
    <p>The 1998 hunt was about getting a degree in enigmatology, and the coin was an MIT diploma (with a seal, not shown above) in said field. This may be the first year when the "coin" was not an actual coin. If you have a picture of the diploma with the actual seal, please <a href="mailto:puzzle@mit.edu">let us know</a>.</p>

    <h3>1997</h3>
    <img src="images/coins/unknown.jpg" class="photoframe">
    <p>Andrew Russell writes:
      <blockquote>
I recall the coin was an early 1800's british coin perhaps a half
crown or half penny featuring King George III.  Since he was the King
when America won its independence from Britain, He was technically the
first King of America.  The theme of the whole hunt that year was
"search for the King".
      </blockquote>
